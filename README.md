### This is a simulation of a race between a rabbit and turtle.

An empty object called Animal is set up that has the following properties:

1. name
2. speed
3. focus

and the following method:

4. run

The run method is a function that compares a random number between 1 and 10 with the focus property. If the random number is less than the focus, a new position property is generated by adding the speed property.

Two different instances of this object are then created:

1. rabbitAnimal
2. turtleAnimal

A new function, race(), is then created. Inside the race function, inside a while loop, the run method is called for both rabbitAnimal and turtleAnimal until either Animal's position exceeds 400 (the distance of the race). The positions are then compared and the greater position wins. The function then returns "'winner name' has won" or "Holy smokes! A tie!"

The race function is then called inside an alert.
